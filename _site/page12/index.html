        (This is my note for the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree on Udacity) Regression The word regression comes from &quot;regression to the mean&quot; like the parent-children height example. Later it actually means using functional form to approximate a bunch of data points. i.i.d.: Independent and identically distributed, a fundamental assumption for the data.

        Without networking, mobile apps can only perceive, process, and present the data that is local to the host device. This greatly restricts the scope of problems which apps can solve and limits their overall utility. By incorporating networking, apps truly become “mobile” -- they can interact with interesting data using popular web services, coordinate multi-user activities, and build experiences that bring users together. This series of posts will cover concepts fundamental to communication over the...

        Logistic regression is widely used to predict binary responses. It is a linear method as described in my other post An Overview of Logistic Regression. Binary logistic regression can be generalized into multinomial logistic regression to train and predict multiclass classification problems. For example, for K possible outcomes, one of the outcomes can be chosen as a “pivot”, and the other K−1 outcomes can be separately regressed against the pivot outcome. In MLlib, the first...

        Why the sigmoid? When I first started to learn logistic regression, I realized there was something missing when the professor explained why we would want a sigmoid function instead of a hard-thresholding 0/1 loss. It was said it’s because sometimes we want the output to be a probability instead of a yes/no decision for practical purposes, and the logistic sigmoid function maps all real numbers to the interval (0, 1). On the other hand, optimizing...
